## using jQuery
This assignment was an introduction to javascript and dynamic content. There is only one page that changes its content when the user clicks on each a tag in the nav bar.
I challenged myself by using an unconventional site layout, with a static header, nav bar, and footer and dynamic content to the right of the nav bar. I think it turned out really well and I styled it according to the content.
